Copy the Request URL and make sure it's the right one by pasting the url in your browser. It should say "Thank you for your feedback"


Paste the request URL in the CSB TikTok Ban Tool and hit enter


You should get a bunch of "Thank you for your feedback" messages as the software will send the request over and over again.  Make sure you're using a VPN in case you get IP banned for sending all of these requests.
